       For the final project of the class, I built a Parkour game! Unity was honestly so easy compared to everything else I endured in this class.
       It felt like an easy roblox game builder. More often than not I would just drag and drop. I decided to make a parkour game because of my love for roblox growing up.
       I would used to play this speed run parkour and it was always in first person, when I first started my project and I was just testing out walking and jumping, it immediately brought me back.
       I honestly did not have much issues, however I did have some hiccups. First, I couldn't get to walk or jump in the game. I easily fixed that by going over to my settings and enable both for active input. 
       Next, I kept getting my objects pink. Like the previous issue, it was an easy fix just going over to settings and enabling my render pipeline. I then kept running into some user error just due to the novelty of me using the program, 
       but I was able to solve all of them and get it going. I added two asset packs, first was <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple-nature-pack-162153">a simple nature pack</a>. 
       This pack just provided some cool trees and rocks, nothing really crazy. The next was <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/animals-free-animated-low-poly-3d-models-260727">an animal pack</a>. 
       This pack was just to add some cool animals to the mix. I added a chicken, a cat, horse, and a moose. Overall this project was another enjoyable experience, I just wish I had more time to edit and make it actually challenging.
       To play the game, I got my girlfriend to give it a shot. There are two clips under one of her playing it shot on my phone, and the other simultaniously on the laptop recording. Unfortunately, I had to cut it just to show how the game is completed 
       due to it being such a large file size
