            For my item I decided that one inconvenience that I have everynight is where my phone is supposed to stay when I fall asleep.
            Unlike a normal person I don't like putting my phone on my nightstand because I tend to knock it off if I let my arm hang off the bed. I also don't put it further
            because when I am tired and ready to go to bed I don't want to sit up and put it further where I won't hit it. So instead I just toss it under my pillow.
            Which esssentially is bad. One, radiation and stuff I assume, another is my phone overheats and somtimes I feel like it and knock it off my bed as well. 
            So I want to make a phone box, that I can attatch by adhesive to my wall beside my bed. I also want to use a magsafe charger for the back of it so the phone can hold magneticly offering extra support.

            This phone holder has been quite enjoyable I feel as if I learned how to manage fusion the best with this one. I did it in a couple of minutes
            and what took the longest was actually finding the dimensions for what I'm going to use. To begin, I got the dimensions for my specific IPhone - 15 pro max. 
            The height being 159 mm I rounded to 160mm especially since it has an open top. I hollowed out the middle to a diameter of 55.6mm which is .1mm larger than the true diameter of the magSafe charger.
            I extruded the flat surface to 4.5mm due to the thickness of the charger. Furthermore, I gave the base of where the phone sits a height of 19.5 mm, the Iphone itself is only 9mm thick but I had to account
            for the distance I extruded as well as for any cases that might be used on the phone. I do not mind have a good wiggle room as well rather than a perfect fit. 
            I then took the sides, and very simply, made a wall using the rectangles and snapping it perfectly according to the height and width I have already set in place. Made sure to extrude these walls outward so that they
            don't cave into it. To ensure the phone doesn't fall out, I made a rectangle on top of the my current build and used the fit point spline to draw out what I did not want to include. 
            Finally, I used the hole feature to create space in the back so that the wire connected to the magsafe can be propperly tucked away.
            
            I thoroughly enjoyed this project and am very exited to print it!

            Final part of this project. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole way through. Every step felt very rewarding, from designing to finally holding my print. 
            The settings that I used for my project was infill 10%, layer height was 0.2mm, and finall,y build adhesion was skirt only 1 loop. Printing-wise, I was very proud.
            My build came out with no issues and exactly how I intended it to. There are some loose strings on the bottom, and it seems like a ripple of loose strings on the back, 
            but none of that actually affected my build. Once I got in my car, I was excited to test it out and I did not account for a couple of things. 
            First, I did not account for my phone case itself, which seems stupid, to be quite frank. Secondly, when I searched up dimensions of my phone, it did not account for either the volume or the power button. 
            So it first seemed like my phone was going to fit in flush, but once it reached the volume knob, it stopped. Lastly, I did not account for the charger diameter.
            as shown in the video, the charger fits in the back, but it will not tuck in. I made the diameter of it too close to the actual size of the charger that it just sort of hovers over it.
            If I was to print again, I would increase the depth of the box as well as the width to allow my phone and its case to fit. Make the diameter of the back charger slit larger and give it less room to pop out. 
            Unfortunately, I am leaving the city earlier because my lease is over, so I can't go back and reprint it as well as take my MagSafe out because its already packed and stored. 
            I really did enjoy this whole project and will definitely try to reprint it so I can use it at my next place.
