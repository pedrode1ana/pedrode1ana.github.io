            For my item I decided that one inconvenience that I have everynight is where my phone is supposed to stay when I fall asleep.
            Unlike a normal person I don't like putting my phone on my nightstand because I tend to knock it off if I let my arm hang off the bed. I also don't put it further
            because when I am tired and ready to go to bed I don't want to sit up and put it further where I won't hit it. So instead I just toss it under my pillow.
            Which esssentially is bad. One, radiation and stuff I assume, another is my phone overheats and somtimes I feel like it and knock it off my bed as well. 
            So I want to make a phone box, that I can attatch by adhesive to my wall beside my bed. I also want to use a magsafe charger for the back of it so the phone can hold magneticly offering extra support.
