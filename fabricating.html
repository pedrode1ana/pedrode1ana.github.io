            For my item I decided that one inconvenience that I have everynight is where my phone is supposed to stay when I fall asleep.
            Unlike a normal person I don't like putting my phone on my nightstand because I tend to knock it off if I let my arm hang off the bed. I also don't put it further
            because when I am tired and ready to go to bed I don't want to sit up and put it further where I won't hit it. So instead I just toss it under my pillow.
            Which esssentially is bad. One, radiation and stuff I assume, another is my phone overheats and somtimes I feel like it and knock it off my bed as well. 
            So I want to make a phone box, that I can attatch by adhesive to my wall beside my bed. I also want to use a magsafe charger for the back of it so the phone can hold magneticly offering extra support.

            This phone holder has been quite enjoyable I feel as if I learned how to manage fusion the best with this one. I did it in a couple of minutes
            and what took the longest was actually finding the dimensions for what I'm going to use. To begin, I got the dimensions for my specific IPhone - 15 pro max. 
            The height being 159 mm I rounded to 160mm especially since it has an open top. I hollowed out the middle to a diameter of 55.6mm which is .1mm larger than the true diameter of the magSafe charger.
            I extruded the flat surface to 4.5mm due to the thickness of the charger. Furthermore, I gave the base of where the phone sits a height of 19.5 mm, the Iphone itself is only 9mm thick but I had to account
            for the distance I extruded as well as for any cases that might be used on the phone. I do not mind have a good wiggle room as well rather than a perfect fit. 
            I then took the sides, and very simply, made a wall using the rectangles and snapping it perfectly according to the height and width I have already set in place. Made sure to extrude these walls outward so that they
            don't cave into it. To ensure the phone doesn't fall out, I made a rectangle on top of the my current build and used the fit point spline to draw out what I did not want to include. 
            Finally, I used the hole feature to create space in the back so that the wire connected to the magsafe can be propperly tucked away.
            
            I thoroughly enjoyed this project and am very exited to print it!
