    <h1> Assignment 2: Working With App Inventor </h1>
    
    <div class="contentRow">
      <div class="aboutMe">
          Working with MIT App Inventor felt like I was reaching my hand into a bag that I couldn't look into. On one hand, I liked how easy and visual everything was like the drag and drop setup and the educational Minecraft command blocks. 
          However, once I actually started building my simple app, I felt limited by the possibilities. 
          After writing proper lines of code for class or taking on challenges with — well, this website for example — I forgot how elementary coding blocks can feel. The way it's set up made me realize how far I’ve come.
          For example, I feel like I’ve been playing in a creative Minecraft world, but when I started messing with the app, it felt more like the Minecraft Lite version I had on the iPod. 
          The app had me a little annoyed — all I was looking for was a while loop so the image could rotate, but I didn’t find anything that fit with my other blocks. 
          So instead, I kept it simple for the sake of it being the first real assignment and focused on organizing this website instead.
          The app I built is very simple: just an FSU image the user can click. When clicked, it plays the FSU war chant. 
          After making that, I couldn’t stop thinking about all the meme apps I could create — just to be annoying, really — and it was honestly fun playing around and seeing what it could do. 
          Even though the app is basic, I can confidently say I can work my way around it.

  <h1> Assignment 3: Teamwork</h1>
  <div class="contentRow">
    <div class="aboutMe">
      Starting out was more complicated than I expected it to be. We ran into issues right off the bat finding some time for us to work together. 
      We then began having issues getting a call together and had to problem-solve a call; imagine, in this day and age, a couple of young adults cannot get on a call. 
      However, we were able to get everyone on a call together and talk a little about the project we want to make. We decided that we want to do a game of some sort—something that we all have played in the past and that could bring some nostalgia to our own childhood. 
      Unfortunately, my pictures came out with a notification for gestures, which ruined my picture, but I asked one of the guys to send me theirs as well. I uploaded both. I am excited to work with this group of men and cannot wait to see what we come up with!
