Portfolio & Emerging Technology Projects

Live Site: https://pedrodelana.github.io

## Overview
This website serves as my personal portfolio and project hub, showcasing work completed across software development, product design, and emerging technologies.

The site was developed and expanded as part of a **Summer Emerging Technology course**, where I explored:
- Web development
- Interactive design
- 3D modeling and visualization

## Course Focus: Emerging Technology
During this course, I worked on multiple projects involving:

- 3D modeling concepts
- Digital prototyping
- Technology-driven design thinking
- Visualization of product and engineering concepts

These projects emphasized how emerging tools can be applied to:
- Product development
- Engineering workflows
- Creative problem-solving

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages (deployment)
- 3D modeling tools (course-based projects)
-   FreeCad
-   Autodesk Fusion
-   TinkerCad

## Website Sections
The site includes:
- Project showcases
- Visual models and design experiments
- Interactive layouts demonstrating technical and creative skills

##  Purpose of the Site
This portfolio was built to:
- Demonstrate applied technical skills
- Document learning across disciplines
- Provide recruiters with a central place to view projects

##  Future Enhancements
- Add product case studies with structured breakdowns
- Embed interactive demos of applications
- Integrate design and development projects into unified workflows
