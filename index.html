            My name is Pedro De Lana, and I was born and raised in South Florida.
            I came to Florida State University hoping to leave as a software engineer,
            but honestly, I’m not sure that’s still the case. This is where I am right now.
            This is me navigating who I want to be on the other side of all this.

            As I practice my skills and work to get better, I hope this class can give me a clearer glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel.
            I’d like to call myself a visionary or an entrepreneur — but what do I have to show for that? Not much, yet.

            I have dreams of owning a company in the fitness industry,
            while keeping one foot in the service world, and my heart in sports.
            I love technology, and my room reflects that — and while I might not master it in the traditional sense, I definitely know my way around it.

            That’s just a glimpse of me. I hope this online journal leads to a new light flickering on somewhere down the tunnel.
